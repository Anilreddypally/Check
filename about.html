    <p>The world-famous Paradise brand has its origins in a small Canteen and a Café in a cinema theatre called Paradise in Secunderabad in the Year 1953.
        A small 100-seater restaurant started serving typical Hyderabadi cuisine like Biryani etc. from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food items to the people as a one-stop Food Store.
        In 1978, Mr A Hemati took complete charge of the Restaurant from his Father & Uncle and set about renovating the Restaurant to suit the changing social trends and the evolving food habits of people in India.</p>
        <p>In 1983 an Air-cooled multi-cuisine Restaurant called Paradise Persis Family Restaurant and the highly popular Paradise Takeaway came up at Secunderabad.

                In 1996, Paradise underwent a major restructuring, renovation and modernization programme. It expanded both vertically and horizontally.</p>
